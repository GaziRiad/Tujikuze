          Tujikuze is proud to be part of a UN initiative aimed at promoting
          sustainable development through ethical fashion. By connecting Kenyan
          artisan groups with global brands, the project empowers communities,
          supports gender equality, and drives economic growth. Together with
          partners like Africa Collect Textiles, Savio Youth Enterprise,
          Virtuous, and Satubo, we create high-quality products that reflect
          Kenyaâ€™s rich cultural heritage.
